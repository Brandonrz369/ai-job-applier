=============================================================================
ORIGIN STORY
=============================================================================

Self-taught from necessity. As a teenager with an overbearing mother,
technology became my outlet and escape. When I had issues with parental
controls, I installed Linux or other tools to remove them. When I didn't
have WiFi, I bought an antenna off eBay and burned a Linux distro to
access neighbors' networks.

This problem-solving mindset -- finding technical solutions to real
constraints -- has defined my approach to IT ever since. I don't just use
tools; I build them. I don't just follow procedures; I create documentation
that prevents 3 AM emergencies.

=============================================================================
WHAT MAKES ME DIFFERENT
=============================================================================

1. Promoted at 18 -- to escalation team handling tickets that stumped experienced techs
2. Security background -- professional pen testing contract at 18, self-taught from childhood
3. Multi-vendor firewall fluency -- Cisco, Fortinet, SonicWall, Palo Alto, Meraki, pfSense -- all in production
4. Entrepreneurial -- built real MSP, won $17K contract, handled emergency outages solo
5. VoIP under pressure -- when 50 phones go down and business is paralyzed, I isolate SIP issues
6. Full stack IT -- help desk to pen testing to MSP owner
7. Documentation obsessed -- network diagrams, runbooks, quick reference cards prevent disasters
8. Builds tools -- not just uses them. This job application came from AI-powered system I built myself
9. ROM developer at 16 -- publishing custom Android ROMs with community following while in high school
10. Works hard -- maintained IT career development while working supervisor, warehouse, and gig jobs
