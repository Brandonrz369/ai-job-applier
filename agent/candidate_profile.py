=============================================================================
ORIGIN STORY
=============================================================================

Self-taught from necessity. As a teenager with an overbearing mother,
technology became my outlet and escape. When I had issues with parental
controls, I installed Linux or other tools to remove them. When I didn't
have WiFi, I bought an antenna off eBay and burned a Linux distro to
access neighbors' networks.

This problem-solving mindset - finding technical solutions to real
constraints - has defined my approach to IT ever since. I don't just use
tools; I build them. I don't just follow procedures; I create documentation
that prevents 3 AM emergencies.

=============================================================================
WHAT MAKES ME DIFFERENT
=============================================================================

1.  PROMOTED AT 18 - to escalation team handling tickets that stumped
    experienced techs
2.  SECURITY BACKGROUND - professional pen testing contract at 18,
    self-taught from childhood
3.  MULTI-VENDOR FIREWALL FLUENCY - Cisco, Fortinet, SonicWall, Palo Alto,
    Meraki, pfSense - all in production
4.  ENTREPRENEURIAL - built real MSP, won $17K contract, handled emergency
    outages solo
5.  VOIP UNDER PRESSURE - when 50 phones go down and business is paralyzed,
    I isolate SIP issues
6.  FULL STACK IT - help desk to pen testing to MSP owner
7.  DOCUMENTATION OBSESSED - network diagrams, runbooks, quick reference
    cards prevent disasters
8.  BUILDS TOOLS - not just uses them. This job application came from an
    AI-powered system I built myself
9.  ROM DEVELOPER AT 16 - publishing custom Android ROMs with community
    following while in high school
10. WORKS HARD - maintained IT career development while working supervisor,
    warehouse, and gig jobs
