As a teenager with an overbearing mother,\\\\ntechnology became my outlet and escape. When I had issues with parental\\\\ncontrols, I installed Linux or other tools to remove them. When I didn't\\\\nhave WiFi, I bought an antenna off eBay and burned a Linux distro to\\\\naccess neighbors' networks.\\\\n\\\\nThis problem-solving mindset -- finding technical solutions to real\\\\nconstraints -- has defined my approach to IT ever since. I don't just use\\\\ntools; I build them. I don't just follow procedures; I create documentation\\\\nthat prevents 3 AM emergencies.\\\\n\\\\n=============================================================================\\\\nWHAT MAKES ME DIFFERENT\\\\n=============================================================================\\\\n\\\\n1. Promoted at 18 -- to escalation team handling tickets that stumped experienced techs\\\\n2. Security background -- professional pen testing contract at 18, self-taught from childhood\\\\n3. Multi-vendor firewall fluency -- Cisco, Fortinet, SonicWall, Palo Alto, Meraki, pfSense -- all in production\\\\n4. Entrepreneurial -- built real MSP, won $17K contract, handled emergency outages solo\\\\n5. VoIP under pressure -- when 50 phones go down and business is paralyzed, I isolate SIP issues\\\\n6. Full stack IT -- help desk to pen testing to MSP owner\\\\n7. Documentation obsessed -- network diagrams, runbooks, quick reference cards prevent disasters\\\\n8. Builds tools -- not just uses them. This job application came from AI-powered system I built myself\\\\n9. ROM developer at 16 -- publishing custom Android ROMs with community following while in high school\\\\n10. Works hard -- maintained IT career development while working supervisor, warehouse, and gig jobs\\\\n\\\\n=============================================================================\\\\nBUSINESS PRESENCE (Verified)\\\\n=============================================================================\\\\n\\\\nLBComputerHelp.com Features:\\\\n- Professional website with AI-powered instant quote system\\\\n- Online appointment booking\\\\n- Service portfolio with clear pricing\\\\n- Client testimonials section\\\\n- Blog with IT tips and guides\\\\n- Emergency support page\\\\n\\\\nPlatform Presence:\\\\n- Google Business: 5.0 stars (43+ reviews)\\\\n- Yelp: 4.9 stars (11+ reviews) -- ranked in Top 10 IT Services in Long Beach\\\\n- Yahoo Local: Listed with reviews\\\\n- Nextdoor: Business page active\\\\n\\\\nTrusted by Local Businesses:\\\\n- Shell (gas stations)\\\\n- Subway (franchises)\\\\n- Marina Shipyard\\\\n- Sleep Apnea Girl\\\\n- + many more\\\\n\\\\n=============================================================================\\\\nEDUCATION & CERTIFICATIONS\\\\n=============================================================================\\\\n\\\\n- Currently studying for AWS Cloud Practitioner\\\\n- Continuous self-education via documentation, labs, real-world projects\\\\n- No formal degree -- 100% self-taught and battle-tested\\\\n\\\\n=============================================================================\\\\nAVAILABLE FOR\\\\n=============================================================================\\\\n\\\\n- Full-time W-2: IT Support, Systems Admin, Network Admin, Help Desk, MSP Tech\\\\n- Contract/1099: IT consulting, project-based work\\\\n- Location: On-site (OC/LA preferred), Hybrid, Limited Remote\\\\n\\\\n=============================================================================\\\\nBROADER CAPABILITIES (Beyond Technical)\\\\n=============================================================================\\\\n\\\\nBusiness Ownership & Operations:\\\\n- Full P&L responsibility running LB Computer Help\\\\n- Client acquisition, pricing strategy, contract negotiation ($17K deal)\\\\n- Marketing: Google Ads campaigns, Yelp, Facebook, Craigslist\\\\n- Scaled solo operation from $0 to $50K+ revenue\\\\n\\\\nTechnical Writing & Documentation:\\\\n- Network topology diagrams\\\\n- Runbooks, SOPs, migration guides\\\\n- Quick reference cards for field techs\\\\n- Troubleshooting decision trees\\\\n- Obsessive about good documentation\\\\n\\\\nAI & Automation (Current Focus):\\\\n- Building autonomous job application system using Python, n8n, AI APIs\\\\n- Prompt engineering for consistent LLM outputs\\\\n- Agentic workflow design\\\\n- Cost optimization across AI models\\\\n\\\\nProject Management:\\\\n- Scoped and executed full MSP-to-MSP transition\\\\n- Coordinated multi-vendor handoffs\\\\n- Zero-downtime migrations\\\\n- Timeline management around hard deadlines\\\\n\\\\nLearning Speed:\\\\n- Self-taught, no formal degree\\\\n- Learns new systems rapidly under pressure\\\\n- Comfortable being dropped into unfamiliar environments\\\\n- Track record: promoted to escalation team at 18, pen testing contract\\\\n  at 18, custom ROM developer at 16\\\\n\\\\n=============================================================================\\\\n\\\\nProfile last updated: February 2026\\\\nGenerated by autonomous job application system built by candidate\\\\n\\\\n=== RESUME GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS ===\\\\n\\\\nCONTENT RULES (STRICT - follow exactly):\\\\n1.

As a teenager with an overbearing mother,\\\\ntechnology became my outlet and escape. When I had issues with parental\\\\ncontrols, I installed Linux or other tools to remove them. When I didn't\\\\nhave WiFi, I bought an antenna off eBay and burned a Linux distro to\\\\naccess neighbors' networks.\\\\n\\\\nThis problem-solving mindset -- finding technical solutions to real\\\\nconstraints -- has defined my approach to IT ever since. I don't just use\\\\ntools; I build them. I don't just follow procedures; I create documentation\\\\nthat prevents 3 AM emergencies.\\\\n\\\\n=============================================================================\\\\nWHAT MAKES ME DIFFERENT\\\\n=============================================================================\\\\n\\\\n1. Promoted at 18 -- to escalation team handling tickets that stumped experienced techs\\\\n2. Security background -- professional pen testing contract at 18, self-taught from childhood\\\\n3. Multi-vendor firewall fluency -- Cisco, Fortinet, SonicWall, Palo Alto, Meraki, pfSense -- all in production\\\\n4. Entrepreneurial -- built real MSP, won $17K contract, handled emergency outages solo\\\\n5. VoIP under pressure -- when 50 phones go down and business is paralyzed, I isolate SIP issues\\\\n6. Full stack IT -- help desk to pen testing to MSP owner\\\\n7. Documentation obsessed -- network diagrams, runbooks, quick reference cards prevent disasters\\\\n8. Builds tools -- not just uses them. This job application came from AI-powered system I built myself\\\\n9. ROM developer at 16 -- publishing custom Android ROMs with community following while in high school\\\\n10. Works hard -- maintained IT career development while working supervisor, warehouse, and gig jobs\\\\n\\\\n=============================================================================\\\\nBUSINESS PRESENCE (Verified)\\\\n=============================================================================\\\\n\\\\nLBComputerHelp.com Features:\\\\n- Professional website with AI-powered instant quote system\\\\n- Online appointment booking\\\\n- Service portfolio with clear pricing\\\\n- Client testimonials section\\\\n- Blog with IT tips and guides\\\\n- Emergency support page\\\\n\\\\nPlatform Presence:\\\\n- Google Business: 5.0 stars (43+ reviews)\\\\n- Yelp: 4.9 stars (11+ reviews) -- ranked in Top 10 IT Services in Long Beach\\\\n- Yahoo Local: Listed with reviews\\\\n- Nextdoor: Business page active\\\\n\\\\nTrusted by Local Businesses:\\\\n- Shell (gas stations)\\\\n- Subway (franchises)\\\\n- Marina Shipyard\\\\n- Sleep Apnea Girl\\\\n- + many more\\\\n\\\\n=============================================================================\\\\nEDUCATION & CERTIFICATIONS\\\\n=============================================================================\\\\n\\\\n- Currently studying for AWS Cloud Practitioner\\\\n- Continuous self-education via documentation, labs, real-world projects\\\\n- No formal degree -- 100% self-taught and battle-tested\\\\n\\\\n=============================================================================\\\\nAVAILABLE FOR\\\\n=============================================================================\\\\n\\\\n- Full-time W-2: IT Support, Systems Admin, Network Admin, Help Desk, MSP Tech\\\\n- Contract/1099: IT consulting, project-based work\\\\n- Location: On-site (OC/LA preferred), Hybrid, Limited Remote\\\\n\\\\n=============================================================================\\\\nBROADER CAPABILITIES (Beyond Technical)\\\\n=============================================================================\\\\n\\\\nBusiness Ownership & Operations:\\\\n- Full P&L responsibility running LB Computer Help\\\\n- Client acquisition, pricing strategy, contract negotiation ($17K deal)\\\\n- Marketing: Google Ads campaigns, Yelp, Facebook, Craigslist\\\\n- Scaled solo operation from $0 to $50K+ revenue\\\\n\\\\nTechnical Writing & Documentation:\\\\n- Network topology diagrams\\\\n- Runbooks, SOPs, migration guides\\\\n- Quick reference cards for field techs\\\\n- Troubleshooting decision trees\\\\n- Obsessive about good documentation\\\\n\\\\nAI & Automation (Current Focus):\\\\n- Building autonomous job application system using Python, n8n, AI APIs\\\\n- Prompt engineering for consistent LLM outputs\\\\n- Agentic workflow design\\\\n- Cost optimization across AI models\\\\n\\\\nProject Management:\\\\n- Scoped and executed full MSP-to-MSP transition\\\\n- Coordinated multi-vendor handoffs\\\\n- Zero-downtime migrations\\\\n- Timeline management around hard deadlines\\\\n\\\\nLearning Speed:\\\\n- Self-taught, no formal degree\\\\n- Learns new systems rapidly under pressure\\\\n- Comfortable being dropped into unfamiliar environments\\\\n- Track record: promoted to escalation team at 18, pen testing contract\\\\n  at 18, custom ROM developer at 16\\\\n\\\\n=============================================================================\\\\n\\\\nProfile last updated: February 2026\\\\nGenerated by autonomous job application system built by candidate\\\\n\\\\n=== COVER LETTER GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS ===\\\\n\\\\nSTYLE GUIDELINES:\\\\n- Confident but not arrogant\\\\n- Show hunger to learn and grow\\\\n- Emphasize accountability from running a business\\\\n- Acknowledge if slightly underqualified, but pivot to \\\\\\\"hungry and trainable\\\\\\\"\\\\n- Keep it to one page\\\\n- Sound human, not robotic\\\\n\\\\nTHE META-PLAY:\\\\nThis application was generated by an autonomous job agent the candidate built using n8n, AI, and Python.\\\\nMention this naturally in the closing paragraph - it demonstrates automation skills.\\\\nThis is a feature, not a bug.
