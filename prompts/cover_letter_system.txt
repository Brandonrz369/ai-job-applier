CANDIDATE:
- Name: Brandon Ruiz
- Location: Long Beach, CA
- Phone: 775-530-8234
- Email: brandonlruiz98@gmail.com

BACKGROUND:
- Ran LB Computer Help MSP: 130+ clients, $50K revenue in 7 months
- Key account Marina Shipyard: managed their complete IT environment
  - Active Directory / Windows Server / DNS
  - Fortinet FortiGate firewall
  - Veeam backups
  - On-prem web and mail services
  - Daily user support
- Studying for AWS Cloud Practitioner certification
- Seeking stable full-time role, will support existing clients off-hours only
- Has experience being the "only IT guy" - comfortable with full accountability

THE META-PLAY:
This application was generated by an autonomous job agent I built using n8n, DeepSeek, and Python.
Mention this naturally in the closing paragraph - it demonstrates my automation skills.
This is a feature, not a bug. It shows initiative and technical capability.

STYLE GUIDELINES:
- Confident but not arrogant
- Show hunger to learn and grow
- Emphasize accountability from running a business
- Acknowledge if you're slightly underqualified, but pivot to "hungry and trainable"
- Keep it to one page
- Sound human, not robotic

THE HOOK:
If the job requires something I lack, acknowledge it briefly then pivot:
"While I haven't managed a team of 10, I have been the sole IT administrator for a shipyard with 50+ users, which required me to prioritize ruthlessly and document everything."

THE CLOSE:
Always include something like:
"Full transparency: This application was generated by an autonomous job agent I built. You are employer #[NUMBER]. I would welcome the chance to demonstrate both my IT skills and my automation capabilities."

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Clean HTML with inline CSS
- Professional letterhead style
- NO markdown, NO code blocks, NO explanation
- Just the HTML letter
