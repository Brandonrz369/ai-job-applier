# Brandon Ruiz - REVISED Strategic Plan
## Philosophy: MSP Ownership = ASSET, Not Liability
## Generated: February 4, 2026 | Powered by Gemini Deep Research

## THE MINDSET SHIFT

**OLD THINKING:** "Hide that I'm an owner, they'll think I'm a flight risk"
**NEW THINKING:** "Companies that don't value my ownership experience aren't worth working for"

Your MSP background isn't something to hide - it's a **filter**. It repels toxic micromanagers and attracts entrepreneurial leaders who need someone with business acumen.

---

## CRITICAL DISCOVERY: $80k IS WAY TOO LOW

Gemini analysis shows $80k in Orange County is **Tier 2 Help Desk salary**.

For someone who:
- Managed P&L for 130+ clients
- Closed $17k enterprise contracts
- Built Python automation tools
- Multi-vendor firewall expertise

**Your actual market value:**

| Role | Salary Range | Your Fit |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Solutions Architect (Pre-Sales) | $130k-$160k + commission | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| vCIO at Large MSP | $120k-$150k | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Technical Account Manager | $115k-$196k | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Head of IT (Startup) | $130k-$160k + equity | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Sales Engineer | $130k-$160k OTE | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

**NEW TARGET: $125k-$135k base**

## THE 30-SECOND PITCH (Lead with Ownership)

> "I'm a Technical Solutions Architect with a unique background—I founded and ran my own MSP in Orange County, managing the full IT stack for over 130 customers and securing enterprise contracts.
>
> Because I've signed the front AND the back of the check, I have a different perspective than most engineers. I know how to align technical requirements—like multi-vendor firewalls and Python automation—with actual business ROI.
>
> I've decided to move away from the administrative side of business ownership to focus purely on what I do best: designing complex technical solutions and helping clients scale."

**Why this works:**
- "Signed front and back of check" = financial literacy (rare in IT)
- "130 customers" = stress tolerance, scale experience
- "Move away from admin" = frames transition as CHOICE, not failure

## INTERVIEW QUESTIONS TO ASK (Filter for Good Employers)

### Green Flags (Companies that will value you)
Ask these questions - good employers will light up:

1. "How much autonomy does this role have regarding tool selection and process automation?"
2. "How does the technical roadmap align with the company's revenue targets?"
3. "What's your philosophy on senior technical staff making decisions independently?"
4. "Do you have engineers who've built their own tools or automations here?"

### Red Flags (Run away)
If they say things like:
- "We follow the ticket SOP strictly"
- "All decisions go through the manager"
- "We don't really do automation here"
- Seem threatened by your decision-making history

## REVISED ACTION PLAN

### This Week

1. **Update LinkedIn headline:**
   "MSP Founder → Solutions Architect | Python Automation | Multi-Vendor Firewalls"

2. **Register for ASCII Edge** (Feb 25-26, Costa Mesa)
   - Network with Rewst, Huntress, Pax8, ConnectWise

3. **Apply directly to:**
   - Ingram Micro (Irvine) - Solutions Architect
   - Trace3 (Irvine) - Solutions Architect
   - Huntress - Partner Enablement (if remote available)

4. **Clean up GitHub job-agent repo** with professional README

### The Bot Strategy

**Keep running it** for volume on Indeed Easy Apply, but understand:
- These $80-95k jobs are your FLOOR, not your target
- The real opportunities come from networking and direct company applications
- Use bot results as practice/backup while pursuing $120k+ roles

## THE "WHY ARE YOU LEAVING YOUR BUSINESS" ANSWER

When asked in interviews:

> "I realized I love the engineering and architecture - building automation, securing infrastructure, solving complex technical challenges. But I found myself spending 60% of my time on invoicing, HR, and client acquisition.
>
> I want to focus 100% on what I do best: designing solutions and automating operations. I'm looking for a role where my business experience is valued, but I can go deep on the technical work rather than running payroll."

---

## SUMMARY: THE NEW STRATEGY

| Old Approach | New Approach |
|--------------|--------------|
| Hide ownership, pretend to be employee | Lead with ownership as differentiator |
| Target $80k "safe" jobs | Target $125k+ roles that match your value |
| Mass apply via bot | Network at ASCII Edge + direct applications |
| "I need a job" energy | "I'm choosing where to deploy my skills" energy |
| Filter for any employer | Filter for employers who value entrepreneurship |

**The companies worth working for will see your MSP background as exactly what they need.**

*"I'd rather be more qualified for the roles that they would give me."* - Your words. This plan reflects that.
