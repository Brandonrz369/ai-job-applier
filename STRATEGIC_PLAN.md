# Brandon Ruiz - $80K+ Job Landing Strategic Plan
## Generated: February 4, 2026 | Powered by Gemini Deep Research

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Goal:** Land an $80,000+ IT role in Orange County within 30 days

**Current Assets:**
- 454 pre-scored jobs (342 are $80k+, avg salary $114k)
- Job bot with 17% Indeed Easy Apply success rate
- Marina Shipyard $17k enterprise contract as portfolio proof
- Multi-vendor firewall + Python automation skills

**Key Strategic Insights:**
1. **Easy Apply ROI is LOW:** 2% interview rate vs 4-6% for external sites
2. **"Ex-Owner" = Red Flag:** Must rebrand as "Lead Infrastructure Engineer"
3. **The Bot IS the Portfolio:** Proves automation skills that justify $80k+
4. **CMMC/NIST is HOT in OC:** Defense contractors desperate for compliance-savvy techs

## THE HYBRID "SNIPER + SHOTGUN" STRATEGY

### SHOTGUN (20% Effort) - Bot Handles This
- Run bot on Indeed Easy Apply for $75-90k "safety net" roles
- Accept 17% success rate as cost of automation
- Zero human time investment

### SNIPER (80% Effort) - You Handle This
- Manual applications to $95k+ external sites (Workday, Greenhouse, Lever)
- Use Simplify/JobWizard browser extension (reduces 15min → 2min per app)
- Target: 3-5 high-value applications per day

## THE "FLIGHT RISK" NARRATIVE (Interview Prep)

**When asked: "Why leave your own business?"**

> "I realized I love the engineering and problem-solving—building automation,
> securing infrastructure, solving complex technical challenges—but I disliked
> the sales and administrative work. I want to join a larger team where I can
> focus 100% on technical architecture rather than invoicing and client
> acquisition."
